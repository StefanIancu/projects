## Purpose 

This portfolio-app lets any developer upload their project and share it to the world. 

## First touch

Once a user clicks the link, they will be prompted into the landing page. They can either check the developer's social media links or they can see the projects. 

To implement here: 
<li>A subscribe function that lets the user subscribe to the developer's app and once a new project is posted, an e-mail should be sent to the user</li>
<li>To fix the redirect links to GitHub and LinkedIn</li>

## Main page

The main page has the "Portfolio" title and it hold together all the uploaded projects. The user can browse through the projects, see a quick description, a suggestive photo and the name of the project.

If the user chooses to "Read more" they will be taken to the project individual page where they can see the technolgy used, the purpose and extra-details on the project. 

To implement here:
<li>A way to upload a video showing the demonstration of the running project</li>
<li>Project type: script, app, web-app, GUI etc</li>

## Add a new project 

There are two ways of adding a new project. 

The first method is to access the Python shell, import the Project class and create an object type Project with the following properties:
