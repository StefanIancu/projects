### Password Generator 
3rd of April 2023 

This is the first entry level project that I have made.
Here I practiced functions, modules and packages, while and for loops, conditions
and others.

## Overlook

## Purpose

To generate a custom safe password for the user. 

## Choices

This app gives the user multiple options.  

1. If the user would like to have digits included in his password. 
2. If the user would like to have symbols included in his password. 
3. The user decides the length of his password. 
* If the user refuses both digits and symbols, basically there is just an alphabetical password. 

Whichever would be the user's choice, a password would never have the same character twice (consecutive). 

For now, the caps and lower cases are combined.
