PASSWORD GENERATOR V3 
3rd of April 2023 

This is the first entry level project that I have made.
Here I practiced functions, modules and packages, while and for loops, conditions
and others.

This project gives the user three (or four) choices: 

1. If the user would like to have digits included in his password. 
2. If the user would like to have symbols included in his password. 
3. The user decides the length of his password. 
*4. If the user refuses digits and symbols, basically there is just an alphabetical password. 

Whichever would be the user's choice, a password would never have the same character twice (consecutive). 

For now, the caps and lower cases are combined.
