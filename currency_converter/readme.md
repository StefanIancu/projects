## Purpose

Let's the user easily convert from RON up to other three currencies. 

## First touch

After the user opens the application, they'll need to introduce a value and click on 
the "RON->" button. The value will be converted in the same time into the three currencies.

## Location-based

The app is telling the user his current location and the real date-time. For this example I turned off my VPN.
